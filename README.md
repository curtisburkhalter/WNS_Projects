# WNS_Projects
This repo contains data and R scripts used to investigate multiple aspects of the spread of White Nose Syndrome in bats worldwide. 

White Nose Syndrome, or WNS, is a fungal disease that has spread rapidly across many species of bats. In order to reduce transmission 
to other colonies of already affected species, or potentially currently unaffected species, it is important that we understand the factors
that influence susceptibility and severity of the disease. 

This project seeks to increase our knowledge of WNS syndrome by investigating the behavioral and environmental variables that relate to 
susceptibility of the species. In order to do so we have employed various machine learning algorithms aimed at identifying what factors 
increase susceptibility of at-risk species. 

Future modeling efforts will investigate the factors related to disease severity, as well as attempt to create a WNS impact index that takes
into account both susceptibility and severity.
